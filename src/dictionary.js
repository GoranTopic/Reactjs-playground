Although the two words look and sound alike, they have very different meanings and histories. \"Venal\" demonstrates the adage that anything can be had if the price is high enough and the morals are low enough. That word originated with the Latin  venum,  which simply referred to something that was sold or for sale. Some of those transactions must have been rather shady, because by the mid-1600s, \"venal\" had gained the sense of corruption it carries today. \"Venial\" sins, on the other hand, are pardonable, the kind that show that everyone makes mistakes sometimes. That forgiving term descends from \"venia,\" Latin for  favor,  \"indulgence,\" or \"pardon.\"",

The first virtuosos were individuals of substantial knowledge and learning (\"great wits,\" to quote one 17th-century clergyman). The word was then transferred to those skilled in the fine arts, and by the 18th century it had acquired its specific sense applied to musicians. In the 20th century, English speakers broadened  virtuoso  again to apply to a person skilled in any pursuit.",

Vulcanize  sounds like something Spock from  Star Trek  might do, but the explanation behind this word has more to do with ancient mythology than it does with science fiction. Vulcanization involves heating rubber in combination with sulfur. The Roman god Vulcan (whose Greek counterpart is Hephaestus) was the god of fire and of skills that used fire, such as metalworking. So when Charles Goodyear discovered that high heat would result in stronger rubber, he called the process \"vulcanization\" after the god of fire. Goodyear stumbled upon the idea in 1839 and acquired a patent for it in 1844, but the words \"vulcanize\" and \"vulcanization\" didn't appear in print until 1845 and 1846 respectively.",

The history of the word prior to the trademark claims is obscure. According to press reports from 2010, a fan of the Kaizer Chiefs football club of Johannesburg, Freddie Maake, claimed to have invented the horn and publicized it in a 1999 ten-track album called \u201cVuvuzela Cellular.\u201d Note that \u201cVuvuzela\u201d was earlier (1995) the name of a popular song by the musician Arthur Mafokate, a pioneer of kwaito (a South African dance music genre); it is not clear if there is a more precise link between the song or its lyrics and the horn. The hypothesis that the word has been borrowed from Zulu has not been substantiated. Words similar in form, as  vumvuzela , a benefactive form of  vumvuza , \u201cscatter, sprinkle,\u201d have no evident semantic relation.",

Adjective  In Latin,  vulnus  means \"wound.\" You might think, then, that the English adjective  vulnerary  would mean \"wounding\" or \"causing a wound\"\u2014and, indeed,  vulnerary  has been used that way, along with two obsolete adjectives,  vulnerative  and  vulnific . But for the lasting and current use of  vulnerary , we took our cue from the Roman scholar  Pliny the Elder . In his  Natural History , he used the Latin adjective  vulnerarius  to describe a plaster, or dressing, for healing wounds.

In other words, someone (or something) can be vulnerable to criticism or failure as well as to literal wounding. When it is used figuratively, \"vulnerable\" is often followed by the preposition \"to.\"",

Take care to distinguish between the near-homophones  veracious  and  voracious , whose similarities in sound mask utterly different meanings.Veracious  (\u201chonest, truthful\u201d), like its cousins  veritable ,  verify , and  very , concerns that which is true.Voracious  (\u201dhaving a greedy or insatiable appetite\u201d), on the other hand, describes the urge to consume large quantities of something, often food, books, or ideas.  One way to remember the difference is that the one with the  E  as its second letter means \"truE,\" and the one with the  O  as its second letter means \"ravenOus.\" Not coincidentally,  these adjectives have near-homophonous noun derivatives:  veracity  (\"truthfulness\") and  voracity  (\"the quality or state of being voracious\"). Did You Know? Voracious is one of several English words that derive from the Latin verb  vorare,  which means \"to eat greedily\" or \"to devour.\" \"Vorare\" is also an ancestor of \"devour\" and of the \"-ivorous\" words, which describe the diets of various animals. These include \"carnivorous\" (\"meat-eating\"), \"herbivorous\" (\"plant-eating\"), \"omnivorous\" (\"feeding on both animals and plants\"), \"frugivorous\" (\"fruit-eating\"), \"graminivorous\" (\"feeding on grass\"), and \"piscivorous\" (\"fish-eating\").",

Voracity  comes to us via the Middle French  voracit\u0113  from the Latin word  voracitas,  which itself comes from  vorax,  meaning \"voracious,\" plus \"-itas,\" the Latin equivalent of the English noun suffix  -ity.  \"Voracity\" is one of two English words that mean \"the quality or state of being voracious.\" The other is \"voraciousness,\" which was once considered to be archaic but has made a comeback. Because \"voracity\" evolved from non-English forerunners, rather than being created in English from \"voracious\" (as was \"voraciousness\"), the word may strike some English speakers as an unusual formation. It's not surprising, therefore, that the more familiar-looking \"voraciousness\" has reappeared - most likely through a process of reinvention by people unaware of \"voracity.\"",

Vol plan\u00e9  (meaning \"gliding flight\") was a phrase first used by 19th-century French ornithologists to describe downward flight by birds; it contrasted with \"vol \u00e0 voile\" (\"soaring flight\"). Around the time Orville and Wilbur Wright were promoting their latest \"aeroplane\" in France, the noun and the verb \"volplane\" soared to popularity in America as terms describing the daring dives by aviators ( Fly Magazine  reported in 1910, \"The French flyers are noted for their thrilling spirals and vol planes from the sky\"). The avian-to-aviator generalization was fitting, since the Wright brothers had studied the flight of birds in designing their planes.",

		"notes": "The History of  Volatile  Is for the Birds Adjective  Volatile  was originally for the birds - quite literally. Back in the 14th century,  volatile  was a noun that referred to birds (especially wild fowl) or other winged creatures, such as butterflies. That's not as flighty as it sounds.  Volatile  traces back to the Latin verb  volare,  which means \"to fly.\" By the end of the 16th century, people were using  volatile  as an adjective for things that were so light they seemed ready to fly. The adjective was soon extended to vapors and gases, and by the early 17th century,  volatile  was being applied to individuals or things as prone to sudden change as some gaseous substances. In recent years,  volatile  has landed in economic, political, and technical contexts far flown from its avian origins.",

The term survives in Modern French as well, both as an adjective having essentially the same meaning as the English term, and as a noun with several meanings (among them \"shuttlecock\"). The influence of French can be seen doubly in the heraldic sense of \"volant\": in heraldic contexts the adjective \"volant\" almost always appears after the noun - a syntax picked up from French along with the meaning. Ultimately, \"volant\" comes from the Latin verb  volare,  meaning \"to fly.\" Another word that came to English through Middle French from  volare  is \"volley,\" which refers to things flying back and forth through the air.",

We have seen evidence for  vwa-lah ,  vwah-la ,  wa-lah ,  wa-la ,  wah-lah ,  wallah , and even  viola  (for those who remember the letters in the word, if not the particular order of them). While these misspellings are more common in informal writing, we have started seeing them in newspapers and other edited sources as well.

The \u201ccombative, bad-tempered woman\u201d sense has a very long history in our language, going back as far as the 16th century and extending well into the 20th.  It may be found in Shakespeare and Swift as well as in latter-day descriptions of mothers-in-law and the names of gun boats.  By mid-century, however,  vixenbegins to be used of glamorous and attractive women.  Perhaps its application to female characters who combined combative and seductive qualities led to the word's reinterpretation.  Or perhaps it was influenced by  fox , another term for an attractive young woman that made its appearance in English around this time.",

		"notes": "The Tie Between  Visceral  and Biology The \"viscera\" are the internal organs of the body-especially those located in the large cavity of the trunk (e.g., the heart, liver, and intestines). The word  viscera  comes from Latin, in which it has essentially the same meaning. Something \"visceral\" has to do with the viscera. In a more figurative sense, something \"visceral\" is felt \"deep down.\" Even in the early years of its use, \"visceral\" often referred to things emotional rather than physiological. For example, in 1640, an English bishop named Edward Reynolds wrote, \"Love is of all other the inmost and most visceral affection.\" This figurative use is the most common use of \"visceral,\" but the word continues to be used in medical contexts as well.",

Beijerinck, in studying tobacco mosaic virus, mistakenly believed that the agent was a fluid ( contagium vivum fluidum , \"living fluid infection\") because it passed through filters capable of trapping bacteria. \u2014 The neuter gender of  v\u012brus  suggests that it was originally an s-stem; forms in text other than the nominative and accusative are perhaps found only in Lucretius. The length of the vowel in Latin, Irish, and Greek, in contrast to the short vowel in Tocharian and Indo-Iranian, has been variously accounted for. M. Mayrhofer ( Etymologisches W\u00f6rterbuch des Altindoarischen ) suggests that the etymon was originally a root noun,  *u\u032f\u012bs, *u\u032fis-\u00f3-,  with lengthening of the monosyllabic vowel; the daughter languages then generalized one or the other form.",

Viridity  did not enter the language until the 15th century, when it was adopted into Middle English (as  viridite ) from Middle French  viridit\u00e9.  The ultimate source of  viridity,  however, is Latin  viriditas  (\"greenness\"), itself drawn from the root  viridis  (\"green\").  Viridis  is also the source (by way of Middle French  verdoyant ) of English  verdant,  as well as  verdancy,  yet another fancy synonym for \"greenness.\"",

However, it is unlikely that the resemblance between the  viola  words and Germanic  *fi\u00fel\u014d-  (whence Old High German  fidula,  Old English  *fi\u00f0ele ; see  fiddle  entry  1 ), a noun probably designating a string instrument, is pure chance, and borrowing from Germanic into Gallo-Romance seems more plausible than the reverse direction (despite the unexplained voicing of initial  f ). Medieval Latin  vitula, vidula  (best attested in English documents) are not necessarily indicative of an earlier Gallo-Romance form of  viola,  as the Germanic etymon may have contaminated the Romance word. There is no likely relation between the Medieval Latin words and Latin  V\u012btula  \"goddess of joy,\"  v\u012btul\u0101r\u012b  \"to utter a cry of exultation,\" which should have developed quite differently in Romance.",

It's not surprising that the two earliest senses of \"vindicate,\" which has been used in English since at least the mid-16th century, are \"to set free\" (a sense that is now obsolete) and \"to avenge.\"  Vindicate  derives from Latin  vindicatus,  the past participle of the verb  vindicare,  meaning \"to set free, avenge, or lay claim to.\" \"Vindicare,\" in turn, derives from \"vindex,\" a noun meaning \"claimant\" or \"avenger.\" Other descendants of \"vindicare\" in English include such vengeful words as \"avenge\" itself, \"revenge,\" \"vengeance,\" \"vendetta,\" and \"vindictive.\" Closer cousins of \"vindicate\" are \"vindicable\" (\"capable of being vindicated\") and the archaic word  vindicative  (\"punitive\").",

Such designs got their name because they often looked like little vines. It wasn't until the late 19th century that usage of  vignette  had shifted to cover a brief literary sketch or narrative, as we commonly see it used today.",

The word may often be found in an  attributive  role, as in the phrases \u201cvigilante justice,\u201d or \u201cvigilante group.\u201d In this slightly broadened sense it carries the suggestion of the enforcement of laws without regard to due process or the general rule of law.",

		"notes": "Changes and  Vicissitude \"Change is not made without inconvenience, even from worse to better,\" wrote British theologian Richard Hooker in the 16th century. That observation may shed some light on  vicissitude , a word that can refer simply to the fact of change, or to an instance of it, but that often refers specifically to hardship or difficulty brought about by change. To survive \"the vicissitudes of life\" is thus to survive life's ups and downs, with special emphasis on the downs.  Vicissitude  is a descendant of the Latin noun  vicis , meaning \"change\" or \"alternation,\" and it has been a part of the English language since the 16th century. In contemporary usage, it most often occurs in the plural.",

Science got this word, as it has many others, from Latin.  Vibrissa  comes from  vibrare,  which means all of the following: \"to brandish,\" \"to wave,\" \"to rock,\" and \"to propel suddenly.\" Other  vibrare  descendents in English include  vibrate,vibrato,  and  veer.",

Woodrow Wilson was speaking of the U.S. flag when he made that statement in an address in June of 1915, but those who engage in vexillology - that is, vexillologists - would likely find the comment applicable to any national banner. Vexillologists undertake scholarly investigations of flags, producing papers with titles such as \"A Review of the Changing Proportions of Rectangular Flags since Medieval Times, and Some Suggestions for the Future.\" In the late 1950s, they coined  vexillology  as a name for their field of research from  vexillum,  the Latin term for a square flag or banner of the ancient Roman cavalry.

Does the verb have something to do with  veteran  \"a person with long experience,\" perhaps indicating that the thing or person vetted is proved to be tried and true?  Interestingly, the word is not related to  veteran  at all, but rather to  veterinarian  \"an animal doctor.\"That noun was shortened to  vet  by the mid-19th century and, within decades, gave rise to a verb  vet  meaning \"to subject (an animal) to medical examination.\"  The verb was soon applied to human beings as well, broadening in sense to \"to perform a medical checkup on.\"  By the early 20th century, this word took on the figurative meaning that is now most familiar: \"to subject a person or thing to scrutiny; to examine for flaws.\"",

The expected Latin adaptation would be  Veron\u012bca , but this appears to be contradicted by modern Romance pronunciations of the name, with stress on the antepenult. Presumably stress has been adapted to names such as  Dominica  formed with the unaccented suffix  -icus.Noun (3)Spanish  ver\u00f3nica , literally,  veronica  entry  2 ; from the fancied resemblance of the pase to the manner in which St. Veronica holds the cloth with Jesus's image in traditional representations of the scene",

Vernissage has its roots in the old practice of setting aside a day before an exhibition's opening for artists to varnish and put finishing touches to their paintings-a tradition that reportedly dates to at least 1809, when it was instituted by England's Royal Academy of Arts. (One famous member of the Academy, Joseph Mallord William Turner, was notorious for making major changes to his paintings on this day.) English speakers originally referred to this day of finishing touches simply as \"varnishing day,\" but sometime around 1912 we also began using the French term  vernissage  (literally, \"varnishing\").

At first he defined  libido  to mean the instinctual energy associated with the sex drive. Later he broadened the word's meaning and began using it to mean the mental energy behind purposeful human activity of any kind; in other words, the libido (for which Freud also used the term  eros,  a Greek word meaning \"sexual love\") came to be regarded as the life instinct, which included sex along with all the other impulses we rely on to keep us alive. But those of us who aren't psychologists use the word simply as a synonym for \"sex drive\".",

That elegant stringed instrument was highly regarded by the Greeks and was used to accompany intensely personal poetry that revealed the thoughts and feelings of the poet. When the adjective  lyric , a descendant of  lyrikos , was adopted into English in the 1500s, it too referred to things pertaining or adapted to the lyre. Initially, it was applied to poetic forms (such as elegies, odes, or sonnets) that expressed strong emotion, to poets who wrote such works, or to things that were meant to be sung; over time, it was extended to anything musical or rhapsodic. Nowadays,  lyric  is also used as a noun naming either a type of poem or the words of a song.",

		"etymology": "History and Etymology for  lynch law  probably after Charles  Lynch  \u20201796 Virginia planter and justice of the peace Note:  The person thought to be the most likely eponym for the phrase  lynch law  (earlier  Lynch's law, Linch's law  and other variants) is Charles Lynch (1736-96), a planter who, as a militia officer during the Revolutionary War, was involved in the suppression of a Tory attempt to seize lead mines in Montgomery County, Virginia, in 1780. Such harsh measures were taken against presumed Tories\u2014including hanging, shooting and whipping, with little concern for a proper trial\u2014that the Virginia governor Thomas Jefferson cautioned Lynch directly; in 1782 the Virginia General Assembly was persuaded to pass an act of indemnity protecting Lynch and others from legal retribution. Remarkably, Lynch himself used the phrase \"Lynch's law\" in a letter of May 11, 1782 to a commercial agent for the lead mines, in which he addresses the mine foreman Sanders's difficulty in gaining the cooperation of the Welsh miners, and the miners' claims that Sanders was abusing them. Lynch thus concludes the letter: \"I am convinc'd a party there is who by Lying has Deceiv'd some good men to Listen to them\u2014they are mostly Torys and such as Sanders has given Lynchs Law too for Dealing with the negroes [i.e., illegally selling slaves] &c.\" (The complete text of the letter held in the Library of Virginia is in  Lynching in America: A History in Documents,  editor Christopher Waldrep, New York University Press, 2006, p. 36-37.) The other principal claimant as the Lynch of  Lynch law  is William Lynch (1742-1820), a Virginia farmer. In October, 1811, a conversation with William Lynch, then living in Georgia, was recorded in the diary of the land surveyor Andrew Ellicott (1754-1820): \"Captain Lynch\u2026was the author of the Lynch laws so well-known and so frequently carried into effect some years ago in the southern states in violation of every principle of justice and jurisprudence. Mr. Lynch resided in Pittsylvania in the state of Virginia when he commenced legislator and carried his system into effect\u2026The Lynch-men associated for the purpose of punishing crimes in a summary way without the tedious and technical forms of our courts of justice\u2026This self created judicial tribunal was first organised in the state of Virginia about the year 1776 from whence it extended southward\u2026.\" (Catharine Van Cortlandt Mathews,  Andrew Ellicott: His Life and Letters,  New York, 1908, pp. 220-22). William Lynch's claim appears to be buttressed by an editorial entitled \"Lynch's Law\" that appeared in the  Southern Literary Messenger  (vol. 2, no. 6, May, 1836, p. 389). The article purports to reproduce the text of a compact written by Lynch, signed September 22, 1780, that vows extralegal retribution \"on a set of lawless men who have banded themselves together to deprive honest men of their just rights and property.\" The language of the text, with no reference to war or Tories, does not fit the times in which it was purportedly written, and it now seems likely that the compact was fictional, created by the  Southern Literary Messenger 's editor, Edgar Allan  poe . It would not have been the only literary hoax perpetrated by Poe (see Christopher Waldrep,  The Many Faces of Judge Lynch: Extralegal Violence and Punishment in America,  New York, 2002, p. 21).",

There is indeed some 17th-century evidence of the word being used for a small celestial moon, but that meaning is now obsolete. Earlier, in the 16th century, \"lunette\" referred to a horseshoe having only the front semicircular part - a meaning that still exists but is quite rare. \"Lunette\" has other meanings too rare for our  Collegiate Dictionary  but included in our  Unabridged . Among these are \"a blinder especially for a vicious horse\" and, in the plural form, \"spectacles.\" (\"Lunettes\" is the usual term for eyeglasses in modern French.) The oldest meaning of \"lunette\" still in common use is \"something shaped like a crescent or half-moon,\" which our evidence dates to circa 1639.",

Luminaria  is a fairly recent addition to English; the earliest known use in our language dates from 1949, about the time that the old Mexican Christmas custom was gaining popularity among Anglo-Americans. In some parts of the U.S., particularly New Mexico, these festive lanterns are also called  farolitos , which means \"little lanterns\" in Spanish. We borrowed  luminaria  from Spanish, but the word has been around with exactly the same spelling since the days of Late Latin. The term ultimately traces to the classical Latin  luminare , meaning \"window,\" and to  lumen , meaning \"light.\" It is related to other light-bearing words such as  luminary ,  illuminate , and  phillumenist  (a fancy name for someone who collects matchbooks).",

Perhaps this explains why \"lugubrious\" is so woeful-it's all alone. Sure, we can dress up \"lugubrious\" with suffixes to form \"lugubriously\" or \"lugubriousness,\" but the word remains essentially an only child-the sole surviving English offspring of its Latin ancestors. This wasn't always the case, though. \"Lugubrious\" once had a linguistic living relative in \"luctual,\" an adjective meaning \"sad\" or \"sorrowful.\" Like \"lugubrious,\" \"luctual\" traced ultimately to the Latin verb  lug\u0113re,  meaning \"to mourn.\" \"Luctual,\" however, faded into obsolescence long ago, leaving \"lugubrious\" to carry on the family's mournful mission all alone.",

According to an unsubstantiated account in George Pellew's  Life of Lord Sidmouth  (1847), Ned Ludd was a Leicestershire villager of the late 1700s who, in a fit of insane rage, rushed into a stocking weaver's house and destroyed his equipment.

Both the \"illustrious\" and the \"emitting light\" sense have fallen out of use, and even the \"clear\" sense is now rare. (When it does appear, it is typically in humorous contexts in which the writer is intentionally choosing obscure words.)

By the 1800s, however, the term had been broadened to refer to any intensive study (day or night), or a composition, especially a weighty one, generated as a result of such study.

		"notes": "Shine a Light on the Origin of  Lucid It's easy enough to shed some light on the origins of  lucid : it derives\u2014via the Latin adjective  lucidus , meaning \"shining\"\u2014from the Latin verb  luc\u0113re , meaning \"to shine.\"  Lucid  has been used by English speakers since at least the late 16th century. Originally, it meant merely \"filled with light\" or \"shining,\" but it has since developed extended senses describing someone whose mind is clear or something with a clear meaning. Other shining examples of  luc\u0113re  descendants include  translucent ,  lucent  (\"glowing\"), and the somewhat rarer  relucent  (\"reflecting light\" or \"shining\").

The label \"lotusland\" is now applied to any place resembling such an ideal of perfection, but it also carries connotations of indolence and self-indulgence, possibly derived from the way the sailors refused to work once they reached the original lotusland.

		"notes": "Did You Know? Lothario  comes from  The Fair Penitent  (1703), a tragedy by Nicholas Rowe. In the play, Lothario is a notorious seducer, extremely attractive but beneath his charming exterior a haughty and unfeeling scoundrel. He seduces Calista, an unfaithful wife and later the fair penitent of the title. After the play was published, the character of Lothario became a stock figure in English literature. For example, Samuel Richardson modeled the character of Lovelace on Lothario in his 1748 novel  Clarissa . As the character became well known, his name became progressively more generic, and since the 18th century the word  lothario  has been used for a foppish, unscrupulous rake.",

In fact, poets quickly snatched up  loquacious  soon after its debut in 1656 and, with poetic license, stretched its meaning to include such things as the chattering of birds and the babbling of brooks. In less poetic uses,  loquacious  usually means \"excessively talkative.\" The ultimate source of all this chattiness is  loqui,  a Latin verb meaning \"to speak.\" Other words descended from  loqui  include  colloquial,eloquent, soliloquy,  and  ventriloquism.",

Each is identified by the number of degrees it lies east or west of the so-called prime meridian in Greenwich, England (part of London). A circle is divided into 360\u00b0; so, for example, the longitude of the Egyptian city of Cairo is about 31\u00b0E\u2014that is, about 31\u00b0 east of London. The \"long\" sense of the root may be easier to see  in some uses of the adjective  longitudinal : A longitudinal study is a research study that follows its subjects over many long years, and a longitudinal engine is one that drives a crankshaft that runs lengthwise under a vehicle (as in rear-wheel-drive cars) rather than crosswise.",

		"examples": [],
		"notes": "Lolita English has a good number of  eponyms , words taken from the name of a real or imaginary person. In some cases, particularly when the word is drawn from the name of a fictional character, it may take on or discard meanings, as when  Romeo  is used to simply mean \u201ca male lover,\u201d with no hint at the tragedy the character faces in Shakespeare\u2019s play. Similarly  Frankenstein  has become for some so disassociated from the name of the doctor who created the monster that we provide the definition \u201ca monster in the shape of a man.\u201d  In some cases it can be disconcerting when an eponym strays in meaning. In Vladimir Nabokov\u2019s 1955 novel,  Lolita , the character Lolita is a child who is sexually victimized by the book\u2019s narrator. The word  Lolita  has, however, strayed from its original referent, and has settled into the language as a term we define as \u201ca precociously seductive girl.\u201d This definition is based on a considerable body of evidence of the word as it is used in published English prose; it is not intended to be a lexicographic reflection of Nabokov\u2019s creation.  The story goes like this: a would-be pop star and Hispanic Lolita from the mean streets of Hell's Kitchen, hungry for fame and hoping to crash the Big Time, takes the D train from Manhattan to East Flatbush in Brooklyn. There she is greeted by an intimidating band of streetwise black musicians\u2014Full Force, they call themselves. They're holding an audition for a singer to record: they want someone \"with the eyes of a woman and the temperament of a girl.\" Loving her style, the band cuts a song with the teenager\u2014\"Lisa Lisa\" they decide to call her. The record is a hit. Presto: a new star is born! \u2014 Jim Miller, et al.,  Newsweek , 22 June 1987  Before  Clueless  hit two years ago, the press had already begun sniping: Citing her video-laden r\u00e9sum\u00e9, an  Entertainment Weekly  cover sneered, A STAR IS MADE. Then Silverstone confounded everyone, leapfrogging from low-rent cult Lolita to bona fide actress. \u2014 David Handelman,  Premiere , August 1997  As the woebegone heroine, Clara, the Bourne veteran Etta Murfitt gives a performance that tugs the heartstrings. Anjali Mehra is equally effective as the snotty, selfish Sugar, a veritable Lolita in crinolines. \u2014 Allen Robertson,  The Times  (London), 6 Dec. 2003 The definition of  Lolita  reflects the fact that the word is used in contemporary writing without connotations of victimization. Words often depart in meaning from the meanings of their sources, and this is as true for those which have come from names as it is for those which have sprung from less easily identified origins.",

Actually, the word  lollapalooza  has been around since at least the 1890s, though etymologists aren't sure where it comes from. Occasionally, it has been used as a gambling term for a made-up hand used to trick an inexperienced player-but primarily the term is used in a way very similar to  humdinger  and  doozy.  It is spelled in a number of ways.  Lallapalooza,lalapalooza,  and  lollapaloosa  are among the variants, and in the past it was sometimes  lalapaloozer.  Pulitzer prize-winning cartoonist Rube Goldberg may have contributed to the popularity of this term with \"Lala Palooza,\" one of his cartoon characters from the 1930s.",

If you're a word enthusiast, you probably know that \"logos\" is the root of many English words (\"monologue,\" \"neologism,\" \"logic,\" and most words ending in \"-logy,\" for example), but what about other derivatives of \"machesthai\"? Actually, this is a tough one even for word whizzes.

Based on surface resemblance, you might guess that \"logy\" (also sometimes spelled \"loggy\") is related to \"groggy,\" but that's not the case. \"Groggy\" ultimately comes from \"Old Grog,\" the nickname of an English admiral who was notorious for his cloak made of a fabric called grogram - and for adding water to his crew's rum. The sailors called the rum mixture \"grog\" after the admiral. Because of the effect of grog, \"groggy\" came to mean \"weak and unsteady on the feet or in action.\" No one is really sure about the origin of \"logy,\" but experts speculate that it comes from the Dutch word  log,  meaning \"heavy.\" Its first recorded use in English, from an 1847 London newspaper, refers to a \"loggy stroke\" in rowing.",

		"notes": "Did You Know? Locofoco  burned brightest in 19th-cenutry America, where it designated a new type of self-igniting match or cigar capable of being lit by friction on a hard surface. The word is believed to combine the adjective  locomotive  (which was commonly taken to mean \"self-propelled,\" though  loco  actually means \"place,\" not \"self,\" in Latin) and the Italian word for \"fire,\"  fuoco.  The political meaning of  Locofoco  is a story in itself. In 1835, a group of radical Democrats brought locofoco matches to one of their meetings after hearing that their adversaries were plotting to disrupt the meeting by putting out the gas lights. The room did indeed go black but was soon relit, thus earning the group its name.",

Both words hark back to Old English, and the  e  ending in each has come and gone over the centuries - but if you want to avoid the ire of those who like to keep the language tidy, stick with  loath  for the adjective and  loathe  for the verb.",

				"the boss was  livid  when yet another deadline was missed",

		"notes": "Did You Know? Livid  has a colorful history. The Latin adjective  lividus  means \"dull, grayish, or leaden blue.\" From this came the French  livide  and eventually the English \"livid,\" which was used to describe flesh discolored by a bruise when it was first recorded in the early 17th century. A slight extension of meaning gave it the sense \"ashen or pallid,\" as used in describing a corpse. \"Livid\" eventually came to be used in this sense to characterize the complexion of a person pale with anger (\"livid with rage\"). From this meaning came two new senses in the 20th century. One was \"reddish,\" as one is as likely to become red with anger as pale; the other was simply \"angry\" or \"furious,\" the most common sense of the word today.",

A littoral combat ship is a fast and easily maneuverable combat ship built for use in coastal waters. And in marine ecology, the littoral zone is a coastal zone characterized by abundant dissolved oxygen, sunlight, nutrients, and generally high wave energies and water motion.  Littoral  can also be found as a noun referring to a coastal region or, more technically, to the shore zone between the high tide and low tide points. The adjective is the older of the two, dating from the mid-17th century; the noun dates from the early 19th century. The word comes to English from Latin  litoralis , itself from  litor - or  litus , meaning \"seashore.\"",

It can now refer to any single factor that establishes the true character of something or causes it to be assigned to one category or another. Often it refers to something (such as an opinion about a political or moral issue) that can be used to make a judgment about whether someone or something is acceptable or not.",
